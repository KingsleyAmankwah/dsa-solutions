## Edabit - Matchstick Houses
This challenge will help you interpret mathematical relationships both algebraically and geometrically.

![](image.png)

Create a function that takes a number (step) as an argument and returns the number of matchsticks in that step. See step 1, 2 and 3 in the image above.

## TEST CASES
```javascript
// TEST CASE 1
console.log(matchHouses(1)) // 6

// TEST CASE 2
console.log(matchHouses(4)) // 21

// TEST CASE 3
console.log(matchHouses(87)) // 436

```
## NOTES
- Step 0 returns 0 matchsticks.
- The input (step) will always be a non-negative integer.
- Think of the input (step) as the total number of houses that have been connected together.
